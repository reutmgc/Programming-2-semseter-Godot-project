Dear professor Dingle, 
I have made a magical board game. In the game, you and a friend play as witches, competing to be more powerful by receiving the most 'Magic Points'.
Game Rules:
- There are 4 card categories: property, reward, fine, and jail. 
- You can choose whether to buy the property you land on. 
- If you land on your opponent's property, you must pay them a fine - 50% of the original price of the property.
- The first to reach zero ‘Magic Points’ loses the game.
- If you land on a jail card, you shall wait 2 turns to break free.
